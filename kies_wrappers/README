These are wrapper scripts, mainly for use with the kies menu system.
Most of them however can be used on their own as commands too.
Some of these scripts make use of the pickafile and catchkey scripts.
Pickafile can be found in the file_browser directory and catchkey in the
menu_system directory.
These scripts make use of various programs, depending on the task for which
the particular script is a wrapper.
Many of these scripts expect to find a $HOME/.kies directory.
Here follows a list with short descriptions of the current scripts.
Most of the scripts are called from some of the menus which can be found in
../menu_system/menus.
